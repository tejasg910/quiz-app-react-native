# React Native Expo App

This is a React Native application built with Expo.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preferably the LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (you can install it globally with `npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tejasg910/quiz-app-react-native.git
   cd quiz-app-react-native
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm i
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will start the Expo development server. You should see a QR code in your terminal.

## Running the App

- To run the app on your iOS device, scan the QR code with your iPhone's camera app.
- To run the app on your Android device, scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.
- To run the app on an iOS simulator or Android emulator, press `i` or `a` respectively in the terminal where the Expo server is running.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed
- Try clearing the npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version
